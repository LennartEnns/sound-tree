# Sound Tree ðŸŽ„
Interactive Audio Fun For Next Christmas.
Visualize your music, tune your instrument, or play Karaoke with your friends!

## Features
### Audio Spectrum Visualization
There are 3 main modes for adjusting the visualization to different kinds of audio:
- `MUSIC`: Distributes frequencies logarithmically (lower frequencies take up more space) and changes LED colors when a beat is detected.
- `HUMAN`: Similar distribution to `MUSIC`.
- `LINEAR`: Linear distribution of frequencies.

The range of frequencies to be used can be set independently of the mode. There are [default values](./soundTree/common.py) set for the ranges and for many other parameters.

Enable [**Normalization Level Tracking**](#customization) to track the maximum loudness over time and use it for normalization.
This enables a more dynamic visual experience (e.g., LEDs may be dim during silent parts of a song if the peak level has been set appropriately by skipping to the loudest part for a moment).

### Karaoke Game ðŸŽ¤
In this game, 2 to 7 players compete to imitate each other's melodies. The tree rates how well a melody has been imitated.

#### Gameplay
Start the [`main-karaoke.py`](./main-karaoke.py) script.
After the LEDs have stopped blinking, you specifiy the number of players:

Clap once for every player and wait for the tree to finish blinking in the color of the added player. Wait a few seconds when you're done.

For every round, each player will be the original singer once.
The LEDs show a short animation in the color of a player to indicate that the player should start singing.

After singing, wait a few seconds for the game to continue.
Imitators will be rated with a score which is shown as a height on the LED strip.

At the end of a round, the average score of each player is shown, starting with the last place.

#### Karaoke Customization
Set the `MAX_ERROR_SEMITONES` constant in [`karaokeEngine.py`](./soundTree/engine/karaokeEngine.py) to specify how high the average semitones deviation of a melody should be in order to get a score of 0 (i.e., the lower you set this, the more "strict" the scoring will become).

### Tuner ðŸŽ¸
The tuner can tune your voice, your guitar and everything else!

Start [`main-tuner.py`](./main-tuner.py) to use the tuner. It uses colors from the `NOTE_COLORS` array defined in [the Engine](./soundTree/engine/tunerEngine.py) to display the estimated target note. For sharps/flats, the colors of the neighboring white notes are used in an alternating order.

The displayed bias will go down from the center in red if the played note is too low, and up in white if the note is too high.

### Customization
You can pass different parameters to the `Engine` classes instantiated in the `main-(...).py` scripts.
These can include:
- Number of frequency points to compute (more = smoother)
- Min and Max Frequency to visualize
- Distribution Mode (see [here](#audio-spectrum-visualization))
- Normalization Level Tracking (Yes/No)
- List of [sender class](./soundTree/sender/) instances. You can use multiple senders at once.

Additionally, there are many constants in [common.py](./soundTree/common.py) and in the ["Engine" classes](./soundTree/engine/) that you can play with.

## Basic Setup 
For these setups to work, you need to have the required things listed under [Requirements](#requirements).

Also, you should adjust the `USB_SERIAL_PORT` constant in [`common.py`](./soundTree/common.py) to match your actual port that the MCU is connected to.

Adjust other constants, e.g. those in [the C++ file](./led_driver/led_strip_controller/src/main.cpp)

Pass instances of the correct [sender classes](./soundTree/sender/) to the `run` methods, depending on your setup.

### Real Tree with LED Strip
Attach the LED strip to the tree (*optional*), connect the LED strip to the Arduino Uno and the Arduino Uno to your device.

### Virtual Tree
Just launch the [web frontend](./webinterface/index.html) + one of the main Python scripts and open [http://localhost:5500/webinterface/index.html](http://localhost:5500/webinterface/index.html) (or whatever port you have set). If the virtual tree does not display any life data, try to reload the site or click the "Connect" button.

## Requirements
### Hardware For The Real Tree Setup
A Tree (*optional*), an LED strip with individually controllable segments, an Arduino Uno MCU for running the LED controller.

### Python Environment
Easy setup:

macos: `brew install portaudio`

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Python Modules
`numpy`, `scipy`, `pyaudio`, `clapDetector`

#### Additional Modules For Real Tree Setup:
`pyserial`

#### Additional Modules For Virtual Tree Setup:
`websockets`

#### Additional Modules For Python Plotting:
`matplotlib`

### Audio Routing
You'll need this if you want to capture system audio, or route an audio stream to multiple outputs.

**Example**: Route System Audio to the MCU **and** to a speaker.

#### For macOS
- BlackHole (2ch) --> Select as input **and** as output to route system audio to the MCU.
- Audio MIDI setup --> For routing an input to **multiple** outputs (see example above).

#### For Other OS
Use other software solutions if necessary.
